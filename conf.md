# IDEAS
Here is a list of ideas for a conference.
That is definitely not the One True Formula For A Conference,
just reminders if someday I was to organize one.
No one conference has the same appeal for the same reason,
"rules" are here to be bent and we love each conf for/despite every variation.

## WANT!
**Why** would I want to come to your conference?
* I like the topics, and you have awesome keynoters
* I will learn new things and meet great people
* the environment feels great, I will want to come back

**How** could you possibly achieve this?
* I can find information about you
* You have a great lineup
* extras are cool

**What** are the keys to all this?
* I have clear information on time
* I can meet and talk with awesome people
* Extras: great venue, city, food and parties
* You are profitable so there is a "next time"


## Starting up
A conference usually starts with an idea,
what you have (city, possibly location and community),
and what you immediately see as desirable (main topic and possibly keynoters).

## Pricing
There's a fine balance between low ticket price and great extras.
Being open and/or opinionated will most often make all quirks acceptable.

Usually, venue, food and speakers' travel/lodging expenses will be the most expensive budget lines.
As the venue will also limit seat capacity, most conferences can afford to keep the tickets' prices low enough through sponsoring.
You don't have to, of course, but if you do, be aware that finding the right balance takes time.

## Communities
You can't possibly envision a conference without the topics' communities.
Sometimes, the conference arise from them. Sometimes, it creates or strengthen them.
Anyway, conferences and communities cannot live without each other.
Giving back is good karma, so please be open and ready to give back.

* be open and inclusive
  - code of conduct
  - be clear on the selection process
    * public voting is cool but optional
  - opening to first-time speakers, possibly with coaching

* give back to communities
  - let people speak with each other
    * schedule, venues, parties, or how lunch is served can help or hinder this

## Communication
### Website
Have a mobile-compatible website, featuring:
* topics
  - then keynoters
  - then speakers
  - then schedule
* date and place
  - dates
  - city
  - venue
* prices
  - number and dates of early birds, expected discount
  - sponsoring plans
  - tariffs for students, benefactors, spouses & kids

### Social Networks
* Twitter: bio has topic, dates and location
* Lanyrd: correctly tagged
  - GitHub: your website is open to contributions on GitHub (optional but very cool)

## CFP
* provide someone to help speakers as soon as they have questions
* topics: what topics are OK or KO? Products, sponsors, inspirational?
  - if it's not the first edition, what worked or did not will help you find examples
* dates: what's the date for CFP opening, closing, choosing, telling speakers and telling everyone?

RubyManor provides an interesting option with fully open CFP: http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/about

### Speakers
* identification: name, social network handles, photo
* speaker package: what's included? Do you pay for lodging and transportation? Is there a limit?
* consider making them acknowledge the code of conduct

### Talks
* identification: title and text
* time: please publish the schedule ASAP
* will they be recorded?
* how product-oriented can sponsor talks be?
* consider Lightning Talks as first-class talks:
  - displayed on site with author bio, title and text, even after, is nice
* please keep talk length short enough: provide with min & max times, question times, etc
* if you do more than one track, be careful

### Selection
Be fully clear and open with the selection process
* how many slots are already reserved, how many are still open?
* consider anonimizing speaker details before voting process


## Conference

### Just before
* visiting town, see Activities
* pre-conference dinner, speakers-only or fully included
* finding the venue
 - why not setting a trip so people meet each other during the trip?

### Talks
* organisation
  - have someone from the staff find the speaker 30mn prior to his talk
  - test the computers, keynote, screens, sound system and video if any
  - provide the speaker with water
  - have someone aside the stage or in the front row make a countdown
   (papers, signs, huge tablet app) often helps stay in the time boundaries

* duration
* questions
* videotaping
* pauses
* food, if you do provide it
  - if you provide the food, have options for allergies and religious restrictions
    * you probably want to let people inform you beforehand
  - (else, provide with a list of closeby, big-capacity restaurants)

* parties
  - well everyone's fun is different
  - remember: too much booze makes it hard to wake up on time
  - parties are the ideal networking/exchanging places, some people like it not-so-loud

* activities: looks like EuRuCamp did things awesomely right
* childcare

### After
* visiting town, speakers and attendees dinner
