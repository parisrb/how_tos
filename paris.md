# Welcome
Welcome to Paris, fellow rubyist, how can we help?

Let's find places you can visit, walk around, eat at, go to or sleep in.
Feel free to comment!

## Visit
"What to do?" http://quefaire.paris.fr/ also with a "kids" version: http://quefaire.paris.fr/enfants

To-dos:
* Monuments
* Places & Museums
For non-obvious travels: http://www.transilien.com/static/touristique/info-touristique
  - Louvre
  - Salle du Jeu de Paume
  - Grand Palais
  - Musée Georges Pompidou
  - Notre-Dame (note the very nice Archaeological Crypt, underneath the place. Stairs on the opposite side of the place)
  - Versailles (the travel is not obvious: RER C to Versailles Rive Gauche, "porte de Versailles" tram & metro do not lead there)
  - Palais de la Découverte

* Entertainment
  - Salle Pleyel
  - Opéra
  - Théâtre Athénée

* Parks & walks
Paris is actually very small.
Walking along the river Seine from the Tour Eiffel to Notre Dame will lead you to most landmarks quite pleasantly.

  - Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle & Jardin des Plantes
  - 12th: Promenade Plantée, from Bastille to Vincennes http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promenade_plantée
  - 13th: Parc Montsouris, Cité des Fleurs, Petite Alsace
  - 14th: Catacombes, I recommend coming in early (also, it's cold, and not disabled-friendly: there are 120 steps down and 83 steps up)
  - 18th: Montmartre
  - 19th: Père Lachaise
  - 19th: La Villette has Cité des Sciences, la Géode, and you can walk the canals to Bastille
  - 20th: Campagne à Paris
  - Bagatelle, Jardin d'Acclimatation

## Food
We the French are passionate about food. Best addresses are open for debate.
Previous great locations include Le Pied de Cochon and le Louchebem, in the
same area you can also try l'Autobus Impérial.

## Travel
Paris has a dense public transportation system (buses, metros, trams, RERs).
I like to walk and use the metro and buses.  If you're moving a lot, look for
unlimited tickets for your stay, for convenience.  If you're just having one or
two journeys a day, that might not be necessary. 

A single ride in the main center (zone 1-2) is around €1.4 when bought by 10; a
one-day pass "Mobilis" is around €7. Note that the daily "Paris visite" ticket
is more expensive ( http://www.transilien.com/static/tarifs/mobilis vs.
http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/r_61654/parisvisite/ ). There might be a good reason
for the price difference but don't ask me why.

## Lodging
The usual for a big city and European capital I guess.

## WiFi
France has a few WiFi communities with which you can get free (rate-limited)
Internet access. Ask your hosts/friends for credentials, which may be helpful.
